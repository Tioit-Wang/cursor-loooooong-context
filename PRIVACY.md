# Privacy Policy

This extension, Project Files Exporter for AI Prompts, does not collect or transmit any user data outside of the user's local machine. It operates entirely locally and does not:

- Track usage
- Collect analytics
- Connect to external servers
- Send any data to any third parties

## Data Usage

The extension only accesses:

1. The workspace file system to read file contents selected by the user
2. VSCode's extension API to display UI components and execute commands

All data processing happens locally on the user's machine. The exported content is displayed in a new editor tab and is not sent anywhere.

## Changes to This Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will update this document accordingly.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the extension's repository.
